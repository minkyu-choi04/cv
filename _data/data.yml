        Overt Attention and Retinal Sampling Improves Adversarial Robustness
          - Improved adversarial robustness of DNN by designing recurrent attention, with potential impacts on explaining the robustness of human vision.
          - Designed a retinal transformation to convert regular images to the representations observed in the primate retina. A deep neural network with retinal transformation showed efficient and robust recognition performance. 
          - Works submitted to AAAI-22 (Under review).

        Visually Grounded Language Model Improves Interpretability of Semantic Space
          - Conducted research on visually grounded language models to make language models have better representations, building a basis architecture for multi-modal neural networks. 
          - Works submitted to NeurIPS-21 (Under review).
    - role: Research Assistant
      time: 2018 - 2019
      company: Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN
      details: |
          - Designed a model capable of predicting saccadic eye movement of humans, using reinforcement learning, possibly explaining principles of human attention. 
          - Developed an auto-encoder model for medical image, improving subject identification accuracy compared to PCA and ICA methods. 
    - role: Research Assistant
      time: 2015 - 2017
      company: KAIST, Daejeon, Korea
      details: |
          - Designed a predictive coding based recurrent network capable of predicting video frames and building meaningful internal representations, showing possibility of predictive coding for computer vision. 
          - Built and documented robot controller softwares using serial communication to be used for human-robot interaction experiments.
